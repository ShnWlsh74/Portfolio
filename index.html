            I graduated in December, 2017, summa cum laude, with a Bachelor's Degree in Geography with three minors (Geographic Information Systems [GIS], Geoscience, and Community and Environmental Planning) from Rowan University.  I was honored with the Delaware Valley Geographic Association’s Outstanding Geography Senior Award in May of 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
            While at Rowan I worked on several projects that have connections to Geography, History and Planning.  I worked on a project with Zachary Christman, PhD., GIS Program Coordinator at Rowan, and Jody Manning, PhD., Assistant Professor, Modern European History at Rowan University and the Director of Programming for Rowan’s Center for Holocaust & Genocide Studies (RCHGS).  The project entailed creating a series of maps, from archival aerial photographs, showing postwar development in and around the former Dachau Concentration Camp and SS Training Grounds, in Dachau, Germany.

            I am currently working as a Geographer for the U.S. Census Bureau and pursuing a master’s degree in Geographic Information Systems and Web Map Programming from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
